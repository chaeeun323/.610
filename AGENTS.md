# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

This repository contains a web-based messaging game using Node and vanilla JavaScript.

## Guidelines for Changes

- JavaScript uses ECMAScript modules (`type: module`) with two-space indentation.
- Avoid external dependencies unless strictly necessary. Use built-in Node modules when possible.
- The dev server is started with `npm start` which runs `server.js`.
- Always run `npm test` before committing changes. If tests cannot run because of missing dependencies, note this in the PR.
- Document any new commands or setup steps in the README.
